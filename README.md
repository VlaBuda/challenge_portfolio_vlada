# Task 1: Software configuration
## Subtask1: Why did I choose to participate in the challenge portfolio?
Maybe it will sound a little strange, but I want to be involved in the creation of quality software. 
It is, you know, something like a mission that you feel.I set myself the goal of learning automation. 
I have already studied manual testing, had some practice. 
And now I'm interested in improving my knowledge, bringing it to a new level.
My expectations are new information that I will be able to use, as well as try myself in an internship (if I am chosen).
